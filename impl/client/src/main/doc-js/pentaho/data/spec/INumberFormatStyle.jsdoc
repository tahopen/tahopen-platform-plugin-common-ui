/**
 * @classdesc The `spec.INumberFormatStyle` interface contains information that
 * affects the style of number formatting.
 *
 * This interface is used to form a
 * {@link pentaho.data.spec.INumberFormatFormat} specification.
 *
 * @example <caption>The default number format style specification</caption>
 *
 *     var numberFormatStyleSpec = {
 *       integerPad:    "0",
 *       fractionPad:   "0",
 *       decimal:       ".",
 *       group:         ",",
 *       groupSizes:    [3],
 *       abbreviations: ["k", "m", "b", "t"],
 *       negativeSign:  "-",
 *       currency:      "$"
 *     };

 * @name pentaho.data.spec.INumberFormatStyle

 * @see pentaho.data.spec.INumberFormatFormat
 * @see pentaho.data.AtomicTypeName.NUMBER
 *
 * @property {string} decimal The character to use in place of the "." mask character.
 *
 * The decimal point separates the integer and fraction parts of the number.
 *
 * The default value is `"."`.
 *
 * @property {string} group The character to use in place of the "," mask character.
 *
 * The group separator groups integer digits according to the
 * sizes in pentaho.data.spec.INumberFormatStyle#groupSizes.
 *
 * Grouping can be disabled, independently of the mask, by specifying "".
 *
 * The default value is `","`.
 *
 * @property {number[]} groupSizes The array of group sizes.
 *
 * The group sizes array must contain at least one element.
 *
 * The last group is repeated indefinitely.
 *
 * The default value is `[3]`.
 *
 * @property {string} negativeSign The negative sign character.
 *
 * The negative sign is used to indicate a negative number
 * when a mask does not have a negative values section.
 *
 * The negative sign is placed leftmost in the resulting string.
 *
 * The negative sign is also used for showing a negative exponent,
 * in scientific notation.
 *
 * The default value is `"-"`.
 *
 * @property {string} currency The currency symbol to use in place of the "¤" mask character.
 *
 * The **currency sign**, ¤, is a character used to denote an _unspecified_ currency.
 * Its unicode is U+00A4 and
 * its HTML entities are &amp;amp;#164; and &amp;amp;curren;
 *
 * See {@link http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currency_sign_(typography)} for
 * more information on the currency sign character.
 *
 * The default value is `"$"`.
 *
 * @property {string} integerPad The character to use in place of a "0" mask character in the integer part.
 *
 * The default value is `"0"`.
 *
 * @property {string} fractionPad The character to use in place of a "0" mask character in the fractional part.
 *
 * The default value is `"0"`.
 *
 * @property {string} abbreviations The possible abbreviations to use
 *    when abbreviating the integer part.
 *
 * Abbreviations are output in place of the "A" or "Abbreviation" mask macros.
 *
 * The first abbreviation is used for the thousands unit,
 * the second to the millions unit,
 * ...
 *
 * Any number of abbreviations can be specified.
 *
 * The default value is `["k", "m", "b", "t"]`.
