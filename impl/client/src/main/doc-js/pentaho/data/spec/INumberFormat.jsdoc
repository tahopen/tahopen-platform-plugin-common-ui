/**
 * @classdesc The `spec.INumberFormat` interface contains all of the information required to
 * format a number value.
 *
 * This interface is used to form a
 * {@link pentaho.data.spec.IFormatProvider} specification.
 *
 * A _number format_ describes how to format numbers by using a formatting mask.
 * The mask syntax is mostly compatible with VB's <i>format()</i> function mask syntax.
 * See {@link http://apostate.com/programming/vb-format-syntax.html}
 * for more information on the mask syntax (only the number related subset is relevant).
 *
 * @example <caption>A sample number format specification</caption>
 *
 *     var numberFormatSpec = {
 *       mask:  "#,0.00 A¤",
 *       style: {
 *         integerPad:    "0",
 *         fractionPad:   "0",
 *         decimal:       ",",
 *         group:         " ",
 *         groupSizes:    [3],
 *         abbreviations: ["K", "M", "B", "T"],
 *         negativeSign:  "-",
 *         currency:      "€"
 *       }
 *     };
 *
 * @name pentaho.data.spec.INumberFormat
 * @interface
 * @see pentaho.data.spec.IFormatProvider
 * @see pentaho.data.AtomicTypeName.NUMBER
 *
 * @property {string} mask The formatting mask.
 *
 * When the mask is `""`, numbers are formatted like JavaScript's `toString()` would.
 *
 * The default value is `""`.
 *
 * @property {pentaho.data.spec.INumberFormatStyle} style The number format style.
 *
 * The default number format style has all of its properties with their default values.
