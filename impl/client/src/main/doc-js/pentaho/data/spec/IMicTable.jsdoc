/**
 * @classdesc The `spec.IMicTable` interface
 * describes the structure of a specification
 * of a table with a crossed structure, and, more specifically,
 * a **Measures In Columns** crossed structure,
 * or _MIC_, for short.
 *
 * A table with a **crossed** structure
 * is a table in which its structure (or layout) is **not** perfectly aligned with its model,
 * but, instead, it is "cross-aligned".
 * Conceptually, it can be viewed like this:
 * * each horizontal line is associated with a distinct set of model entities,
 *   identified by a tuple of discrete attributes,
 *   that are said to be playing the "crossed-row" role
 * * each vertical line is associated with another distinct set of model entities,
 *   identified by another tuple of discrete attributes,
 *   that are said to be playing the "crossed-column" role
 * * the intersection of an horizontal and a vertical line:
 *   * is, thus, associated to the single model entity contained
 *     in the intersection of the horizontal and vertical entity sets
 *     (by construction, the intersection is considered to contain a single entity)
 *   * contains a tuple of continuous attributes,
 *     that are said to be playing the "crossed-measure" role
 *
 * The actual table layout differs from this conceptual view
 * and is what justifies the name _MIC_. It's organized as follows:
 *
 * * each row is associated to a distinct set of model entities
 * * columns are divided in two sections (and thus each row as well):
 *   1. the first section contains a fixed number of _plain columns_,
 *      each corresponding, in order, to the attributes playing the "crossed-row" role
 *   2. the second section contains a variable number of _columns_,
 *      each corresponding to a distinct combination of:
 *      * a measure attribute playing the "crossed-measure" role, and
 *      * a cell tuple with the structure of the attributes playing the "crossed-column" role.
 *
 * The `layout` property specifies
 * the attributes that are playing each of the described crossed roles.
 *
 * A crossed-layout can have any number of attributes in any its roles.
 *
 * @name pentaho.data.spec.IMicTable
 * @interface
 *
 * @property {number} version The version of the table specification format.
 *
 * Currently, the only possible value is `3`.
 *
 * When unspecified, the latest version known by the _interpreter_ is assumed.
 *
 * @property {pentaho.data.spec.IModel} model The model specification.
 *
 * Can be empty or not be specified at all.
 *
 * @property {pentaho.data.spec.ICrossedStructure} layout The structure (or layout) of the crossed table.
 *
 * @property {Array.<pentaho.data.spec.CrossedColumn>} cols
 * An array of column specifications.
 *
 * Indexes less than the number of row attributes,
 * as specified in `layout.rows`,
 * must contain plain column specifications,
 * {@link pentaho.data.spec.PlainColumn},
 * while greater indexes must contain _MIC_ column specifications,
 * {@link pentaho.data.spec.MicColumn}.
 *
 * When the table has column and/or measure attributes,
 * as specified in `layout.cols` and `layout.meas`,
 * it is required to specify at least as many
 * column specifications as there are row attributes.
 *
 * @property {Array.<pentaho.data.spec.Row>} rows An array of row specifications.
 *
 * Can be empty or not be specified at all.
 *
 * @example <caption>A "Measures In Columns" cross table specification</caption>
 *
 *     var micTableSpec = {
 *       model: [
 *         "family",
 *         "product",
 *         "year",
 *         {name: "sales", type: "number"}
 *       ],
 *       layout: [
 *         rows: ["family", "product"],
 *         cols: ["year"],
 *         meas: ["salesAmount", "salesQty"]
 *       ],
 *       cols: [
 *         "family",
 *         "product",
 *         {attr: "salesQty",    c: [2013]},
 *         {attr: "salesAmount", c: [2013]},
 *         {attr: "salesQty",    c: [2014]},
 *         {attr: "salesAmount", c: [2014]}
 *       ],
 *       rows: [
 *           {c: ["cars",   "bmd-i100",      2,   500000,  3,   800000]},
 *           {c: ["cars",   "fiord-feast", 120,  5000000, 60,  2200000]},
 *           {c: ["plains", "bing-123",   null,     null, 20, 85000000]}
 *       ]
 *     };
